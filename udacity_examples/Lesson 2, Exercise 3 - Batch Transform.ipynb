    "In the last exercise, we asked you to reflect on the disadvantages of having to perform preprocessing on a local machine. In addition to those disadvantages, such as user error and hardware limitations, you may have also encountered another frustration in submitting a large amount of data to an endpoint. There may be network limitations on your end, there may be security/privacy concerns, and there might be an obvious performance advantage in parallelism that may be difficult to implement. "

AWS SageMaker, similar to other tools that we encountered, does the heavy implementation lifting of reading data and splitting the burden among instances. All that's required of us is to give batch transform the correct directions to the data we want to submit. "
